Question 1:

    Decide whether you think the following statement is true or false. If it is true, give a brief explanation. 
    If false, give a counterexample.
        
        True or False? In every instance of the stable matching problem, there is a stable matching 
        containing a pair (m, w) such that m is ranked first on the preference list of w and w is 
        ranked first on the preference list of m.

    
    ANSWER:
    
        I believe that the answer is False. An example of this can be made through the Hogwarts scenrio you provided.

        Imagine you had four new students named Sam, Tom, Jill, and Blake. Their preferences are as follows:
            Sam: Gryfindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw
            Tom: Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryfindor
            Jill: Gryfindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin
            Blake: Gryfindor, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, Ravenclaw

        The house preferences are:
            Gryfindor: Tom, Sam, Jill, Blake
            Slytherin: Jill, Sam, Tom, Blake
            Ravenclaw: Blake, Sam, Tom, Jill
            Hufflepuff: Tom, Sam, Jill, Blake

        No matter how the individuals are picked in this scenrio, no house/student match will be 1st on each other's list. If Gryfindor
        gets Tom, he would rather go to Slytherin. As well as, if Gryfindor gets anyone but Tom, they will not be getting their priority pick either.
